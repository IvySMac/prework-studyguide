# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

A study guide created not only for future reference, but also a tool to understand the basic building blocks of coding. This study guide was a great way to baby-step my way into the world of coding. I was able to learn the distinct functions of HTML, CSS, and Javascript-how they are used, when and why, and how to apply them in the future. I have a long way to go, but this project is a great diving off point.

## Usage

You can use this study guide as a reference to come back to if you are stuck on commands, need to remember important coding terms, or well, study! For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). A console panel should open either below or to the side of the webpage in the browser. There you will see a list of topics we learned from the prework along with a suggestion on which topic to study first.
